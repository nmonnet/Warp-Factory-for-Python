# Warp-Factory-for-Python


This code represents the outcome of an exploration I conducted on how to compute the stress-energy tensor for a given spacetime metric. My goal is to replicate the functionality of the "Warp Factory" code described in the paper arXiv:2404.03095.

In contrast to the approach in that study, I aim to leverage the full capabilities of SymPy and EinsteinPy to derive analytical expressions for various quantities of interest, avoiding reliance on numerical approximations whenever possible. This symbolic approach allows for greater flexibility and precision in theoretical investigations.

I may introduce additional constraints on the physicality of the energy-momentum tensor, particularly when negative energy arises, as discussed in arXiv /9702026.

At this stage, the code is more of a collection of potential applications without a clear overarching theme or direction.
